# Contributing
The rules for contributing are simple:
- If you want to contribute, make a pull request.
- Make sure that your addition was fully thought through. I strive to keep NLang as a place to easily write code, and not a place to write code that is hard to read or use.
- Make sure that your addition is useful.
- Make sure that your addition is not a duplicate of something that already exists.
- When you make a pull request, make sure that you have tested your code, and that it works 100% of the time, and does not clash with other features.

That's all! Thanks for contributing, and welcome to the NLang community!
